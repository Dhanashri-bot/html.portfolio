        <p>Hi, I'm Dhanashri Bharasakle. I'm always learning new things, and right now I'm really excited about web development!

            In school and college, I did okay â€“ I got 79% in 10th grade and 87.50% in 12th grade. I recently finished my degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at P.R. Pote College of Engineering in Amravati.
            
            I'm not afraid of challenges, and I always try to get a little better every day.</p>
